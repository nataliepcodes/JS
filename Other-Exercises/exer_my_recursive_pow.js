//recursive means executed repeatedely, calls the func within the same func
//different from iteration
//iteration is a set of instructions exec repeatedly until condition is true
//the func calls inself multiple times to with ever smaller exponents to achieve a repeated multiplication
//exponentiation is the operation of raising one quantity to the power of another
//The exponent of a number says how many times to use the number in a multiplication. 8Ëš
